# Adapter

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.

The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object.

**Usage examples**: The Adapter pattern is pretty common in TypeScript code. Itâ€™s very often used in systems based on some legacy code. In such cases, Adapters make legacy code work with modern classes.

**Identification**: Adapter is recognizable by a constructor which takes an instance of a different abstract/interface type. When the adapter receives a call to any of its methods, it translates parameters to the appropriate format and then directs the call to one or several methods of the wrapped object.
